# Contrived Example

---
### Purpose
To demonstrate the differences between a basic Retrofit implementation and one with RxJava, particularly as it pertains to testing

---
### Architecture
This sample uses an MVP architecture, but for simplicity only the interface for the view is provided, no implementation

---
### Running the app
The app cannot be run in the traditional sense as it lacks any Activities, but unit tests can be run in the UserPresenterTest and RxPresenterTest classes, or via the gradle command testDebugUnitTest
